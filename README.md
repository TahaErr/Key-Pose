Posture Monitoring with Key Pose Estimation
"The disease of the 21st century: Sitting!"
This project aims to tackle one of the most common modern-day health challenges — poor posture due to prolonged sitting — by leveraging computer vision and deep learning.

Using key pose estimation, this system continuously monitors the user’s sitting posture during their workday and classifies it as either “good” or “poor”. The goal is to increase awareness, track long-term habits, and help users improve their posture over time — without interrupting their workflow.

🎯 Key Features:
Real-time pose estimation using a lightweight YOLO-based model

Classification of sitting posture into good vs poor

Tracking of:

Total sitting time

Poor posture duration

Number of posture changes

Longest continuous poor posture interval

Daily summary reports for self-monitoring and habit improvement

🧪 Tested in Real-Life:
The system was tested across two full workdays (09:00–17:00, with a 1.5h break). The results showed measurable improvements on Day 2 through increased awareness and behavioral change.

💡 Why This Project?
For many of us — developers, designers, engineers — sitting is not a choice; it's part of the job. This tool was built out of a personal need to address posture-related discomfort without reducing productivity. Now it's shared in the hope that it can help others too.
